# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-using-SVM
The objective of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Detection and Classification using Support 
Vector Machines (SVM) is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify 
the presence and severity of DR in retinal images. Diabetes frequently results in diabetic 
retinopathy, which damages the blood vessels in the retina and can result in blindness or 
vision loss. Accurate identification and diagnosis of the disorder are essential since early 
discovery and prompt treatment can stop or slow the progression of DR. An effective 
machine learning algorithm for classification tasks is SVM.
